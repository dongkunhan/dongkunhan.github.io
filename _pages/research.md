**Multi-vehicle autonomous driving via multi-agent reinforcement learning**{: style="color: RoyalBlue;" }

Controlling multiple autonomous vehicles is quite challenging in a mixed traffic where it coexists with human-driven vehicles. In this work, we
formulate the multiple autonomous vehicle driving problem as a multi-agent reinforcement learning problem, where the autonomous vehicles collaboratively learn a policy to adapt to human-driven vehicles, under interactions with other autonomous vehicles. A scalable learning algorithm is provided for time-varying interaction and communication. Parameter sharing and local rewards are exploited to foster inter-agent cooperation while achieving a desirable scalability. An action masking scheme is used to elevate learning efficiency by filtering out unsafe actions at each step. In addition, a novel priority-based safety supervisor is proposed to prevent collision and dramatically expedite the training process. In this way, a gym-like simulation environment is built with three different levels of traffic densities. We exploit curriculum learning to efficiently learn harder tasks from trained models under simpler settings. Comprehensive experimental results show the proposed framework consistently outperforms several state-of-theart benchmarks.

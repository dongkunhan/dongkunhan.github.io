Dongkun Han is currently a lecturer at the [Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering](http://www.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html). 
> ***He experiences failure in teaching on a daily basis because he cannot prevent students from sleeping in his lectures. He believes teaching is so challenging that one lifetime isn't enough to master it. Teachers need to carry on getting better until they quit, retire or die... That is the deal to be a teacher.***{: style="color: RoyalBlue;"} 

He earned his Ph.D. degree at the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.eee.hku.hk/) from the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/), supervised by Prof. [Graziano Chesi](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~chesi/).

Dongkun Han is currently a lecturer at the [Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering](http://www.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html). 
> ***He experiences failure in teaching on a daily basis because he cannot prevent students from sleeping in his lectures. He believes teaching is so challenging that one lifetime isn't enough to master it. Teachers need to carry on getting better until they quit, retire or die... That is the deal to be a teacher.***{: style="color: RoyalBlue;"} 

He earned his Ph.D. degree in the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.eee.hku.hk/) from the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/), supervised by Prof. [Graziano Chesi](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~chesi/).

From 2013 to 2014, he was an exchange research student at [Information Systems Laboratory](https://isl.stanford.edu/), [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), USA. He was a visiting academic faculty at the [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://tum-asia.edu.sg/electrical-engineering/), [German Institute of Science and Technology-TUM Asia](https://tum-asia.edu.sg/), Singapore. The focus of his research is on the AI technology and robotics education, cooperative control of multi-agent systems, robustness of uncertain systems, and stability of nonlinear systems.
